      "We propose MultiLLM-Chatbot, a benchmarking framework for evaluating LLMs across domains with hallucination detection.",
    abstract:
      "In this work, we introduce MultiLLM-Chatbot, a benchmarking framework designed to evaluate leading LLMs (GPT-4-Turbo, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, LLaMA-3.3-70B, DeepSeek-R1-Zero, Gemini-2.0-Flash) across five domains: Agriculture, Biology, Economics, IoT, and Medical. Using 50 peer-reviewed research articles, we generated 1,250 model responses and assessed them through multi-metric evaluation, including semantic similarity, sentiment analysis, TF-IDF scoring, and hallucination detection.\n\nOur findings highlight LLaMA-3.3-70B as the most consistent performer across all domains, while also showcasing how our framework provides a scalable, reproducible pipeline for domain-specific LLM benchmarking. This approach addresses key challenges like bias, hallucinations, and factual consistency â€“ helping researchers and practitioners make informed decisions when applying LLMs in industrial and scientific fields.",

    description: "This study introduces a novel drone-based video dataset and evaluates YOLO models for real-time military target detection and tracking, achieving high accuracy with minimal human intervention.",
    abstract: "This research introduces a new drone-based video dataset designed for military surveillance and evaluates state-of-the-art YOLO deep learning models (YOLOv5, YOLOv8, YOLOv11) for real-time detection and monitoring. Our experiments show that YOLOv11s, combined with ByteTrack, deliver the best balance of precision and efficiency for tracking enemy assets, enabling autonomous surveillance with minimal human intervention.By integrating advanced detection and tracking techniques, this work contributes to the development of reliable, real-time vision systems for defense applications, highlighting the growing role of AI-driven drones in enhancing security and operational effectiveness.",

    description: "We explore how big data analytics enables predictive maintenance in transportation, reducing downtime, improving asset reliability, and optimizing operational efficiency.",
    abstract: "This research examines how big data analytics can enhance maintenance in the transportation industry by reducing downtime, enhancing asset reliability, and optimizing costs. Through case studies, we examine the role of descriptive, predictive, prescriptive, and cognitive analytics in decision-making, stakeholder management, and operational flexibility.Our study bridges the gap between available data and its effective application in real-time predictive maintenance, offering both theoretical frameworks and practical strategies for manufacturing organizations. By adopting these approaches, transportation companies can extend the life cycles of their assets, enhance operational efficiency, and maintain a competitive edge in an ever-evolving industry.",
